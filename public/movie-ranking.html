<h3>Across the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>Miles Morales returns for the next chapter of the OscarÂ®-winning Spider-Verse saga, an epic adventure that will transport Brooklyn's full-time, friendly neighborhood Spider-Man across the Multiverse to join forces with Gwen Stacy and a new team of Spider-People to face off with a villain more powerful than anything they have ever encountered.

<h3>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</h3>
<p>Super-Hero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and the Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), the family finds themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of what they thought possible.</p>

<h3>John Wick: Chapter 4 </h3>
<p>Crisp, clear camera work where you can see the stunts, punches, and gunfights? Sweet cars and exotic locales? Impossibly cool one-liners? Yeah, we are thinking action movies are back. Since John Wick's 2014 high-concept debut (don't get between an ex-assassin and his dead wife-gifted puppy), Keanu Reeves and his creative team (including former Matrix stunt guys turned directors, Chad Stahelski and David Leitch) have booted the shaky cam and manic edits that have plagued American action movies to the curb, reviving old-school muscular filmmaking with modern polish.</p>
